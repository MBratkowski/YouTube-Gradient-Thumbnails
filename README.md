## Installation

### From Source
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-gradient-thumbnails.git
```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to:
```
chrome://extensions/
```

3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the Releases page
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Follow steps 2-4 from the "From Source" section

## Usage

After installation, the extension will automatically:
- Transform video thumbnails into gradients
- Display video titles, channel names, and view counts in a clean format
- Show a custom progress bar for watched videos
- Hide distracting elements while maintaining essential information

No additional configuration is required, though you can disable the extension through Chrome's extension manager if needed.

## Customization

The extension uses carefully selected colors that are ADHD-friendly by default. However, you can customize the appearance by modifying the `content.js` file:

```javascript
// Customize gradient colors
const defaultPalettes = [
    {
        primary: '#4A90E2',
        secondary: '#5B9FEF'
    },
    // Add your custom color pairs here
];

// Customize progress bar color
ytd-thumbnail-overlay-resume-playback-renderer #progress {
    background-color: #48A88D !important;
}
```

## Project Structure

## Technical Details

The extension works by:
1. Identifying video thumbnails on YouTube pages
2. Extracting colors from channel avatars
3. Generating smooth gradients based on these colors
4. Creating a clean overlay with essential video information
5. Replacing the original thumbnail with the gradient version
6. Maintaining YouTube's functionality while reducing visual noise
